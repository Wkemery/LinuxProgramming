COSC 3750, Homework12

This is the psuedocode for mmult.c, homework 12
-------------------------------------------------

Validate input first

set index value such that it always points to first matrix

if 3 arguments compute matrix multiply using no threads
	open matrices
	set up indeces for each spot in final matrix
	calculate size of final matrix
	if invalid perror and exit
	calculate each postiion in matrix in order
	write out after computation

	after all that close the output file	

else if 4 arguments	compute matrix multiply with threads
	store number of threads
	if invalid perror and exit
	open matrix files
	calculate size of final matrix
	if invalif perror and exit
	create two indeces that represent spots in final matrix
	create and initialize mutex for row column vars
	create and initialize mutex for output file
	create and initialize condition variable for output file

	create all threads
	
loop:
	lock outifle mutex
	wait on cv
	write out data
	unlock outifle matrix

pthread join all threads
close all files
		

else 
	print error and exit

threadfunction
lock row/column mutex
retrive its assignment and update row/column vars
unlock mutex

read in rows and columns and do matrix multiply

only signal cv for main thread after all previous threads have signaled
use mutex for this. ensures all threads signal main in order
eg 1,1 must have signaled before 2,1 which must signal before 3,1 and so on
going to need vars for completed row and columns
