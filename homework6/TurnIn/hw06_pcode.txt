COSC 3750, Homework6

This is the pseudocode for wytar.c, homework 6
-------------------------------------------------

if there are no arguments, print an error and exit

else there are arguments, process them
for every option:
    if current argument starts with a "-", its an option
    process every option in the current argument(set flags for options)
    if current option is -f, take note of next argument as the filename to be created or extracted
    skip next argument.
    if option is not supported, print error message and exit
    if current argument did not start with a dash, I'm done processing options, process parameters

if option c and option x were set, print error and exit program
if neither option x nor option c were set, exit program

else if creating a tar file(option -c):
if there are arguments to be written to tar file:
create target tar file
open tar file
for every parameter(the remaining arguments):
	call function to create a tar header from file
    if its a directory, procces directory with function
    else call function to write out file to tar
after processing all arguments write out two 512 byte blocks of \0 characters
close file

else if extracting a tar file (option -x):
open tar file
for every record:
call function to construct tar header from tar file's first 512 bytes
call function to create file based on tar header data
read in 512 bytes at a time and write out until you have written the original size of the file in bytes

function: create tar header from file
get stats on file
create tar header based on stats from file
calculate checksum

function: construct tar header from tar file
read 100 bytes, set to name
read 8 bytes, set to mode
read 8 bytes, set to uid
...

function: create file based on tar header data
create directory for file if needed
create file
set permissions

function:write out file to tar 
call function to create tar header from file
    write the tar header to target tar file
    write file data to tar file
        open file to be written out
        read in data from file in 512 byte blocks
        write out data to open tar file in 512 byte blocks, except last block which will be less than 512
        padded with \0 characters to 512 bytes

function: process directory
open directory
read directory
for all items in directory except . and ..:
if its a directory process directory
else write file out to target
close directory
